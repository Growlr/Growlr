Although my history is a mystery, I like the people & other dogs I have met here at HSU.  It is unknown if I have been around cats or children before.  I may or may not be fully house trained…some of us transfer animals have lived our entire lives in a loving home environment, while others have never lived indoors or been part of a family.  I can tell you that we are all very eager to learn!

I may need some guidance & a healthy dose of patience while I'm learning the ropes.  A regular daily routine, positive reinforcement, crate training & exercise will help me learn to be the very best canine companion I can be!  If you do decide to take me home, the behavior staff at HSU is here to help me succeed, so feel free to contact them if you need help!

If you think we're a match, please bring your family (including other dogs) to The Humane Society of Utah to meet me today!

Best with experienced pet owners, they require a bit of extra training as they work towards becoming the best companions they can be. At HSU, we know they are well worth the effort!

What I have to offer:

- I have loads of love to give & am very loyal to those I’m bonded to.
- I’m extremely intelligent & very motivated to learn, especially when there are treats involved!
- I’m very athletic! I love to run & enjoy playing fetch.

What I’m working on:

- Reactivity in kennel environment: Take me out for a walk & see what a different dog I become! 
- Resource guarding: I tend to be a bit greedy when it comes to my food, bones & toys.
- Social skills with new dogs: I’m insecure when meeting new canines & prefer dogs who respect my space.

What I’m looking for:

- A very active household with herding dog experienced owners & no kids under 13 years of age. 
- A secure yard, with supervision outside.
- Canine companions who are similar to my own size & will respect my personal space.
- Ample mental stimulation & lots of exercise.
- Ongoing positive reinforcement training to help with resource guarding

- Body Handling Sensitivity: I enjoy physical attention on my own terms. I prefer gentle, soft petting but I’m not a fan of being hugged or restrained, especially not by strangers.

What I’m looking for:

- A low traffic home with no kids under 13 years of age.

- Well socialized canine companions who can help me come out of my shell & build up my confidence.

Best with experienced pet owners, they require a bit of extra training as they work towards becoming the best companions they can be. At HSU, we know they are well worth the effort!

What I have to offer:

- I have loads of love to give & I’m very loyal to those I’m bonded to.
- I already know cues for sit & stay.
- I'm super silly & energetic once I’ve had a chance to come out of my shell.

What I’m working on:

- Body Handling Sensitivity: I enjoy physical attention on my own terms. I prefer gentle, soft petting but I’m not a fan of being hugged or restrained, especially not by strangers.
- Social skills with new people: I’m shy at first when it comes to new people so I’ll need proper, slow introductions when meeting strangers.
- Social skills with new dogs: I’m insecure when meeting new canines & prefer dogs who respect my space.

What I’m looking for:

- A low traffic home with experienced dog owners & no kids under 13 years of age. 
- Well socialized canine companions similar in size to help me come out of my shell & build confidence.
- Understanding adopters who know it will take time & patience to help me overcome my fear of new people.
- Ample mental stimulation & exercise are going to be a daily necessity for me once I come out of my shell.
- Ongoing positive reinforcement training for socialization & handling sensitivity.

Best with experienced pet owners, they require a bit of extra training as they work towards becoming the best companions they can be. At HSU, we know they are well worth the effort!

What I have to offer:

- I already know cues to sit, lay down & shake!
- I’m already crate trained!
- I’m extremely intelligent & very athletic! I love to run & enjoy playing fetch.

What I’m working on:

- Impulse control: I have a lot of energy & can get a bit carried away when I’m frustrated.
- Resource guarding: I tend to be a bit greedy when it comes to my food, bones & toys.

What I’m looking for:

- A very active household with herding dog experienced owners & no kids under 13 years of age. 
- A secure yard, with supervision outside. (I’ve been known to be a bit of a Houdini!)
- Canine companions who are similar to my own size & energy level.
- Ample mental stimulation & lots of exercise.
- Ongoing positive reinforcement training to help with impulse control & resource guarding.

Although my history is a mystery, I like the people & other dogs I have met here at HSU.  It is unknown if I have been around cats or children before.  I may or may not be fully house trained…some of us transfer animals have lived our entire lives in a loving home environment, while others have never lived indoors or been part of a family.  I can tell you that we are all very eager to learn!

I may need some guidance & a healthy dose of patience while I'm learning the ropes.  A regular daily routine, positive reinforcement, crate training & exercise will help me learn to be the very best canine companion I can be!  If you do decide to take me home, the behavior staff at HSU is here to help me succeed, so feel free to contact them if you need help!

If you think we're a match, please bring your family (including other dogs) to The Humane Society of Utah to meet me today!

What I’m working on:

- Basic manners: I still need training to learn some of the basics, like potty training & house manners.

- Canine companions similar in size & energy level.
- Forgiving neighbors! (I’m a hound who loves the sound of my own voice.)

Best with experienced pet owners, they require a bit of extra training as they work towards becoming the best companions they can be. At HSU, we know they are well worth the effort!

What I have to offer:

- I’m playful & affectionate with people once I’ve had a chance to warm up!
- I’m extremely intelligent & eager to learn!
- I’m well-mannered & walk great on a leash!

What I’m working on:

- Social skills with other dogs: I’m uncomfortable around other canines & prefer brief encounters with mellow dogs who respect my space.
- Basic manners: I have some training under my belt already, but there is always room for improvement!

What I’m looking for:

- An active household with experienced dog owners & no children under the age of 8. 
- A home where I can be the star of the show & won’t have to share the spotlight with another dog. 
- A home with no cats or other small animals. (I’m a little too interested in them, if you know what I mean.)
- A new stylist! (I will require regular professional grooming to keep me comfortable & healthy.)
- Ample mental stimulation, daily exercise & ongoing positive reinforcement training.

Think this might be the right pet for you? Talk to a staff member today!

                AVAILABLE","The Pets in Progress program is HSU's initiative to successfully place animals who are currently working on some behavioral challenges. Best with experienced pet owners, they require a bit of extra training as they work towards becoming the best companions they can be. At HSU, we know they are well worth the effort!

What I have to offer:

- I’m extremely intelligent & very motivated to learn, especially when there are treats involved!
- I’m a perfect gentleman on a leash, as long as I’m walked using a no-pull harness.
- I already know cues to sit & wait.

What I’m working on:

- Resource guarding: I tend to be a bit greedy when it comes to my food, bones & toys. 
- Basic manners: I have some training under my belt already but there is always room for improvement!
- Chewing: I love to chew so I’ll need to be supervised whenever I’m given appropriate toys & treats to work on.

What I’m looking for:
- A very active household with hound dog experienced owners & no kids under age 13.  
- Canine companions similar in size & energy level.
- A secure yard, with supervision outside.
- Ample mental stimulation & lots of exercise are going to be a daily necessity for me.
- Ongoing positive reinforcement training for socialization & basic manners.

Think this might be the right pet for you? Talk to a staff member today!

Although my history is a mystery, I like the people & other dogs I have met here at HSU.  (I do seem to prefer male canine companions to other females.)  It is unknown if I have been around cats or children before.  I may or may not be fully house trained…some of us transfer animals have lived our entire lives in a loving home environment, while others have never lived indoors or been part of a family.  I can tell you that we are all very eager to learn!

I may need some guidance & a healthy dose of patience while I'm learning the ropes.  A regular daily routine, positive reinforcement, crate training & exercise will help me learn to be the very best canine companion I can be!  If you do decide to take me home, the behavior staff at HSU is here to help me succeed, so feel free to contact them if you need help!

If you think we're a match, please bring your family (including other dogs) to The Humane Society of Utah to meet me today!

Although my history is a mystery, I like the people I have met here at HSU.  It is unknown if I have been around other cats, dogs or children before I arrived.  Some of us transfer animals have lived our entire lives in a loving home environment, while others have never been part of a family.  

I have been through a lot of transition lately & while we felines don't typically like to admit our weaknesses…change can be a bit hard for us & we tend to adjust slowly. I may need as long as a couple of months to fully decompress & settle in to my new home.  A regular daily routine, positive reinforcement, play time & time to myself will help me learn to be the very best feline companion I can be!  If you do decide to take me home, the behavior staff at HSU is here to help me succeed, so feel free to contact them if you need help!

If you think we're a match, please bring your family to The Humane Society of Utah to meet me today!

My temporary home is:

I am housetrained for the most part. I will try to tell you when I need to go, but I may have a few accidents until we get our routine down. I'm good with dogs, not sure about cats. I might be better with older children, as I like to jump on people when excited and I still mouth/play bite. Ie loves sleeping on the couch and cuddling with my head on your lap. I also loves sticks, the bigger the better. I knows the command sit and seem to know fetch, though whether I let you take the toy to throw it again is another matter...

For more information or to meet me, contact the Foster Dept at 801-261-2919 x215.  My adoption fee is $88 which includes this year's vaccinations (excluding rabies), deworming, neuter, microchip, a certificate for a free exam with a participating local veterinarian, and a slip leash to take me home.","KODO"
